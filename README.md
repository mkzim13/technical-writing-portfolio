# ✨ Marc Zimmerman — Technical Writer & API Documentation Specialist

Welcome — I’m Marc Zimmerman, a technical writer with a background in engineering, aviation, and structured documentation. I create clear, developer‑focused content that helps teams ship reliable, well‑understood software. My work blends technical depth with accessibility, making complex systems easy to understand and easy to use.

This portfolio showcases my approach to API documentation, XML‑based technical content, diagrams, and developer experience writing.

# 🧭 Start Here (For Recruiters)

If you're reviewing my portfolio, this section gives you the fastest path to understanding my work.

### **1. My Featured Projects**
These two samples demonstrate my range across API documentation and structured XML content.

- **DocuMagic PDF API Documentation**  
  A complete, end‑to‑end API documentation set including a User Guide, Reference Guide, diagrams, and a GitHub‑ready README.  
  ➡️ `documagic-api-docs/`

- **A320‑Style Mode Control Panel (XML Project)**  
  A fictional avionics component documented using XML, XSLT, and structured content principles. Demonstrates my ability to model complex systems, create schemas, and produce clear, modular technical documentation.  
  ➡️ `a320-mcp-xml-project/`

### **2. My Writing Strengths**
- API documentation (REST, authentication, OAuth, rate limits, versioning)  
- Structured content design (DITA‑influenced)  
- XML, XSLT, JSON, Markdown  
- Developer experience writing  
- Diagrams and workflow modeling  
- Clear, accessible explanations of complex systems  

### **3. My Background**
I bring a unique blend of engineering training (computer science and aeronautics) and hands‑on technical writing experience. My work is shaped by systems thinking, precision, and a focus on clarity and usability.

# 🎯 About This Portfolio

This portfolio is designed to demonstrate:

- How I structure documentation  
- How I think about developer experience  
- How I communicate complex ideas clearly  
- How I design modular, scalable documentation sets  
- How I work across both API and XML‑based technical content  

It’s a living project — I’ll continue adding samples, diagrams, and writing as I grow.
